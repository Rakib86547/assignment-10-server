In a statement, Biden said the aid will allow Ukraine to acquire air defense systems, artillery systems and munitions, drones and other equipment 'to ensure it can continue to defend itself over the long term.' The announcement comes as Ukraine is celebrating its 1991 declaration of independence from the Soviet Union."
